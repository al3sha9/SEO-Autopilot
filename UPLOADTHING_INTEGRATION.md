### 2. **New Files Created**

#### `/lib/uploadthing.ts`
- UploadThing file router configuration
- Defines `imageUploader` route with 4MB limit
- Handles image uploads and returns public URLs

#### `/lib/uploadthing-utils.ts`
- Utility functions for image upload/delete operations
- `uploadImageToUploadThing()` - Uploads image buffers to UploadThing
- `deleteImageFromUploadThing()` - Deletes images from UploadThing

#### `/app/api/uploadthing/route.ts`
- API route handler for UploadThing operations
- Exports GET and POST handlers for file operations

### 3. **Modified Files**

#### `/app/api/generate/route.ts`
- Added import for `uploadImageToUploadThing`
- Modified `generateBlogImage()` function to use UploadThing instead of local storage
- Images are now uploaded directly to UploadThing and URLs are returned

#### `/lib/langchain-agent.ts`
- Updated `imageGenerationTool` to use UploadThing instead of Firebase Storage
- Changed from Firebase upload to UploadThing upload

#### `/README.md`
- Added UploadThing setup instructions
- Added environment variables documentation
- Included step-by-step setup guide

#### `.env.example`
- Added UploadThing environment variables:
  - `UPLOADTHING_SECRET`
  - `UPLOADTHING_APP_ID`

## Benefits

1. **Cloud Storage**: Images are stored in the cloud instead of local filesystem
2. **Scalability**: No local storage limitations
3. **CDN**: UploadThing provides CDN for fast image delivery
4. **Reliability**: Professional file hosting service
5. **Easy Management**: Built-in file management and deletion capabilities

## Setup Required

1. Create UploadThing account at [uploadthing.com](https://uploadthing.com)
2. Get API keys from dashboard
3. Add environment variables to `.env.local`:
   ```
   UPLOADTHING_SECRET=your_secret_here
   UPLOADTHING_APP_ID=your_app_id_here
   ```

## Usage

The integration is automatic - when images are generated by Hugging Face AI:
1. Image is generated via Hugging Face API
2. Image buffer is uploaded to UploadThing
3. Public URL is returned and stored in blog post
4. No additional code changes needed

## Testing

- Build test passed successfully
- All routes compile without errors
- UploadThing API routes are properly configured

## Migration Notes

- Old local storage code has been replaced
- Firebase Storage code in LangChain agent has been replaced
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
